# ARWS_analog

Hello!

This is Atollic project for stm32f103.
This project has no RTOS, it's working as event-driven state machine.
Main purpose of this software is to control analog module to get and filter data from temperature sensors(pt100) and wind sensors. 
There is also a terminal console used via rs-485 or usb. Usb is used for calibration and sertification, RS for connecting as one of the weather station modules.


Best regards, Dmitriy.
